# Voice-Based Email for Visually Challenged People



Voice-Based Email for Visually Challenged People is a project aimed at developing an accessible email application that enables visually challenged individuals to compose, send, and manage emails using voice commands. This project leverages speech recognition, text-to-speech technologies, and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) for an enhanced user experience. Unlike traditional email systems, this application has a minimal, noise-free interface specifically designed for blind users.

## Abstract

One of the most common forms of communication among people is email. A lot of confidential and urgent information is exchanged over emails. There are about 253 million visually impaired people worldwide. These visually impaired people face challenges in digital communication. Since technology is growing day by day, visually challenged people often find themselves at a disadvantage.

To address this issue, we developed a **Voice-Based Email System using AI** that makes email systems easily accessible for visually challenged individuals. Accessibility was the top priority while developing this system. It provides a seamless and intuitive email experience through **voice commands**, **text-to-speech conversion**, and **IVR-based interaction**. By integrating **Gmail API**, the system ensures secure and reliable email communication. Unlike traditional email interfaces, this system has a **minimal, noise-free** design tailored for blind users.
